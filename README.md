This directory contains code which creates a closed spline curve from discrete point data defining a domain 
 using the Wilson-Fowler algorithm, then calfem is used to create a quadrilateral mesh inside the domain.
Finally, the Laplace-Beltrami mesh enhancement method (Hansen, Douglass, Zardecki) is used to smooth the mesh.
